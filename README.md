# Canadian-Wind-Energy
Solo project done to explore data about Canada's wind turbine development over the years. 

Created a Jupyter Notebook first to clean up and analyze the data, as well as create initial basic visualizations. Then created multiple Tableau visualizations of the data to develop one primary dashboard to present to audience.

You can find the link to the [final Tableau dashboard I created here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/manaar.salama/viz/CanadianWindEnergy/CanadasWindEnergyEffort)

Information about the data: [original data can be found here.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-27/readme.md) I loaded this in as `wind-turbine.csv` to the Jupyter Notebook. `turbines.csv` is the final, clean version of the data that I used for the dashboard.
